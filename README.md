# Dependencies

- numpy
- skimage (for image reading, can be replaced by cv2 or other such libraries)
- matplotlib (for visualizing image, can also be replaced by skimage, cv2, or other such libraries)

### Requires an RGGB bayer domain image file

- The file I use in this repository is called "color_checker.pgm". I took this image from Mr. Qui Juipin's repository, fast-OpenISP (https://github.com/QiuJueqin/fast-openISP). All of the code is my own.
- The image can also be downloaded at this google drive public folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10v-zYS3jZPgDn0IxzZH8v7MW8SD_cREL?usp=sharing
